                    <p>This portfolio website is a project I am undertaking to enhance my HTML and web development skills. Through it, I aim to display my talent and create a professional representation of my work.</p>
                    <p>The project focuses on the use of HTML semantic naming conventions to ensure the site is well-structured, accessible, and optimised for mutiple displays. (mobile etc...) The design focuses on being visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
                    <p>For more details, you can view the <a href="https://github.com/william-uni/portfolio" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> where its updates/history is documented.</p>

                <div class="project-details">
                    <p>During my security placement at SSE, I undertook a project utilizing PowerQueries to process data from a monthly Excel file/report. This project involved loading, filtering, and digesting data, which is then visually represented through graphs.</p>
                    <p>These graphs are automatically updated on a live dashboard on a SharePoint site using an auto-refresh queue I have setup.</p>
                    <p>This live dashboard provides users with an at-a-glance view of security and vulnerability concerns. Users can filter or drill down further into the data for even more insights. <i>(Note: Information on graphs has been blurred/censored for obvious reasons.)</i></p>
